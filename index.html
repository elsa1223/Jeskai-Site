					<p>5 colors: White, Blue, Black, Red, and Green. WUBRG. There are 31 combinations of these colors. What makes the intersection of white, blue and red so special? Simply put, it is the most wizardly color combination.</p>

					<p>The fantasy for me when playing a a fantasy game like Magic is to be a powerful spellcaster, vanquishing opponents with my cunning and strength. It certainly isn't to wait while a series of mooks do all the fighting. In Magic terms, that means casting instants and sorceries, enchantments and artifacts. Creatures and equipment are right out. Planeswalkers could go either way. They are flavored to be powerful companions, so if you fancy yourself in an adventuring party with Chandra and Ajani, they would certainly fit.</p>

					<p>Red and Blue alone may seem like optimal combination for spellcasting. "Leave White and its weenies out of this," you say, "we're here to shoot fireballs and draw cards." This is wrong for one easy reason: Any self respecting wizard needs enchantments and artifacts. Gandalf had them and so should you.</p>

					<p>Now that we've established that we're definitely sticking with White, Red, and Blue to be a powerful wizard, what does that leave us to work with?</p>

					<p>Starting at the top of the pie with White, we get:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Enchantments</li>
						<li>Damage Negation/ Redirection</li>
						<li>Graveyard Recurrence</li>
						<li>Artifact Fetching</li>
						<li>Cannon Fodder Minions</li>
